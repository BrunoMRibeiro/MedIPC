INTRODUCTION 

Hello, we are the MedIPC. We are a college team created to build a project were you, an IPC student, can add and keep track of your medical information such as your vaccination booklet or your future appointments. 
Our team is composed by 6 Computer Engineering students at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra.

REQUIREMENTS 

In order for you to run our application you need an mobile Android smartphone with at least Android 5.0. We made this choice so we can reach at least 94% of Android smartphones. 
Our application is local so if you delete the app you will lose all the information that you have inserted in the application.

SOURCE CODE 

We used Intellij IDEA as the IDEA to develop our application and the Android SDK we used the API 21. We worked on Java 16.0.1.

Our code is divided in various components, each one of them being the 4 parts of our application, the Appointments module, the Medication module, the Alarm module and the Vaccination module. The path is "MedIPC/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/".
